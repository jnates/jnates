I am an Electronic Engineer specialized in Software Development Processes and currently pursuing my 3rd semester of a Masterâ€™s in Software Engineering.

With experience as a Full Stack Developer, I work with technologies such as React, Angular, NestJS, Spring Boot, Java, Golang, Python, and TypeScript. I am skilled in building scalable architectures, RESTful APIs, and microservices-based solutions.

I have hands-on experience in cloud environments like AWS and Azure, along with DevOps tools like Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes. I also focus on software quality practices, including SonarQube and Clean Code, to ensure maintainability and performance.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked on projects in sectors such as finance, banking, and telecommunications, where I led teams and applied agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban. I am proactive, always looking to improve, and passionate about creating solutions that deliver real value to users and clients.
